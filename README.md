## Installation & Setup

Make sure you've [`git`](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) & [`nodejs`](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed in your system. We advise using Node version 8 or above, and npm version 5.7 or above.

Open terminal and follow these steps;

- Step 1: Clone the repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KhalisFoundation/akhar-punjabi-games/
```

You should now see a `Akhar-Punjabi-Games` folder in your present working directory. Let's change directory to it.

```bash
cd akhar-punjabi-games/
```

- Step 2: Install dependencies.

```bash
# `ci` doesn't update package.json, and uses package-lock.json to install intended deps.
# This makes it pretty speedy and doesn't cause unintended updates.
npm ci
```

This will use `npm` that is included with `nodejs` to install project dependencies.

- Step 3: Start the project.

If you are running this project for the first time or did some change, run the following command,

```bash
expo start
```

If you come accross the following error:
```bash
 ERROR  Invariant Violation: AsyncStorage has been removed from react-native core. It can now be installed and imported from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage' instead of 'react-native'. See https://github.com/react-native-async-storage/async-storage
```

It is a well-known issue in react-native which can be resolved by commenting the code shown below in the file at destination 'node_modules/react-native/index.js'. Save and redo step 3 (if the issue persists, feel free to post it)
